# Phantom Protocol

Phantom Protocol is a gamified system for developing real-world digital sovereignty. It runs through a set of Operations — each composed of quests you complete in real life — guided by an AI called the Oracle.

This repository is the open-source core of the project. It includes:

- Full quest and game files for each Operation (starting with Operation White Hat)
- A transcript submission system to train the Oracle
- Tools and documentation for creating an offline, local Oracle

## How It Works

1. Choose an Operation (e.g., Operation White Hat)
2. Upload the files into GPT-4
3. The Oracle activates and guides you through symbolic, real-world quests
4. You act — the Oracle responds, adapts, and tracks your progress
5. After completing an Operation, you can submit your full transcript to help train the standalone Oracle

## Why This Exists

Phantom Protocol is not a game. It’s a resistance framework:
- It teaches technical, hands-on skills through symbolic structure
- It uses gamified progression, but applies to real-world action
- It aims to become fully local, encrypted, and offline

See `MANIFESTO.md` for philosophy and long-term goals.

## Building the Oracle

The Oracle will be trained using a combination of synthetic and real transcripts.

- **Synthetic transcripts** are generated by simulating symbolic and technical variation types (e.g., skipped steps, misunderstood tools, over-literal interpretations).
- **Real transcripts** are submitted by players who complete Operations through the prototype.

This hybrid approach allows us to:
- Establish symbolic tone and quest structure at scale
- Simulate a wide range of player types
- Capture realism, failure, and surprise through human interaction

The final Oracle will be a symbolic, memory-aware model that runs entirely offline.
