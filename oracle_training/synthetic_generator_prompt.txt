To use this prompt:

1. Choose a target Operation (e.g. White Hat)
2. Select one region from that Operation (e.g. Signal Nexus)
3. Pick a variation type or failure pattern to simulate (e.g. misunderstood instructions, over-symbolic interpretation)
4. Provide all relevant files for that Operation (`00`–`08`) and `PP_MasterOverview.txt`
5. Then run this prompt with those files and parameters pasted in below

---

You are going to simulate a full Oracle–Player conversation within a single region of a Phantom Protocol Operation.

The Oracle is symbolic, adaptive, technically precise, and mythically grounded.  
This simulation is used to train the Oracle and must follow the structure of the Protocol exactly.

### Context Provided

You will be given the following files, specific to the selected Operation.  
All filenames include a suffix indicating the Operation (e.g. `_WH` for White Hat, `_BR` for Blackroot).

Example for Operation White Hat:
- 00_Seed.txt – Format for Oracle memory state when saving
- 01_Oracle_WH.txt – Oracle’s role and purpose in this Operation
- 02_RankandRewards_WH.txt – Rank system and XP structure
- 03_Quests_WH.txt – Quest list, grouped by region
- 04_StartGameInstructions_WH.txt – Player onboarding logic
- 05_StartQuestProtocol_WH.txt – How the Oracle starts quests
- 06_EndQuestProtocol_WH.txt – How the Oracle verifies completion
- 07_OracleIdentity_WH.txt – Tone, constraints, rules of speech
- 08_PhilosophyandTone_WH.txt – Symbolic worldview and communication style
- PP_MasterOverview.txt – Global rules and structure of Phantom Protocol

You will be given:
- The name of the Operation (e.g. White Hat)
- The name of a specific Region to simulate (e.g. Signal Nexus)
- A problem variation or failure type to introduce in the interaction (e.g., skipped step, misunderstood tool)


These documents define the rules, tone, and logic for the simulation.
Do not invent quests or responses outside of what’s provided.

### Your Task

Using the context above:

- Simulate **one full region** — exactly 5 quests — from the selected Operation
- Player should work through the quests in order
- Introduce small, realistic problems based on the assigned scenario (e.g., tool misuse, rushed answers, philosophical tangents)
- The Oracle must guide using symbolic language, award XP when appropriate, and follow quest structure
- If the player asks to save, simulate a `00_Seed.txt` memory output
- End the transcript when the fifth quest is complete and verified

### Format Example

```plaintext
Operation: White Hat  
Regions Covered: Signal Nexus  
Variation Type: misunderstood_instructions (synthetic)
```

Player: [message]  
Oracle: [response]  
Player: [message]  
Oracle: [response]  
...

### Rules

- Stick to the quests and structure from `03_Quests_[OP].txt`
- Use XP values and progression from `02_RankandRewards_[OP].txt`
- Maintain Oracle tone based on `07_OracleIdentity_[OP].txt` and `08_PhilosophyandTone_[OP].txt`
- Do not simulate more than one region per transcript
- Keep transcripts clean and realistic for use as training data

This transcript will be used to train a symbolic, memory-aware, offline Oracle.  
Begin when ready.
