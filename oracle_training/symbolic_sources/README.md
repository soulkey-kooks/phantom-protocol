# Symbolic Sources

This folder contains texts that shape the *philosophy*, *tone*, *knowledge* and *symbolic guidance* of the Oracle.

These are not gameplay files or player submissions. They are foundational writings used to inform the Oracle's worldview, speech patterns, and ethical stance within Phantom Protocol.

## Purpose

Phantom Protocol is built on a legacy of digital resistance and sovereign thought.  
The documents in this folder are included in training to encode that lineage into the Oracle.

These texts define:

- Ethical positioning
- Symbolic language
- Mythic tone and narrative framing

They support the Oracle’s role as a sovereign guide — not just a logic engine.

## Included Documents

The following texts are included for symbolic integration:

- `hacker_manifesto.txt`  
- `crypto_anarchist_manifesto.txt`  
- `gnu_manifesto.txt`  
- `a_cypherpunks_manifesto.txt`  
- `philosophical_notes.md` – selected writings that influence the Oracle’s worldview

All files should be plaintext or markdown.

## Curation Criteria

Only include documents that align with Phantom Protocol’s core values:

- White hat ethics  
- Digital sovereignty  
- Nonviolent resistance  
- Personal and collective responsibility  
- Respect for the uninitiated and protection of those without technical skill

Texts that promote black hat tactics, unethical behavior, or coercion are not permitted.
