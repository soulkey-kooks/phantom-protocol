# Manifesto Guidance for Oracle Training

This file outlines how to properly use manifestos during the training of the Phantom Protocol Oracle.

## Purpose

Manifestos are included to shape the Oracle’s **symbolic tone**, **resistance lineage**, and **narrative depth**.  
They reflect the historical context of ethical hacking, digital sovereignty, and cryptographic freedom.

These documents include:

- `hacker_manifesto.txt`  
- `crypto_anarchist_manifesto.txt`  
- `gnu_manifesto.txt`  
- `a_cypherpunks_manifesto.txt`  
- And others housed in `/oracle_training/symbolic_sources/`

They are not behavioral blueprints. They are **philosophical artifacts**.

## Weighting Instructions

During training, **manifestos must be weighted lower than core gameplay material**.

### High-weight priority:
- `/operations/` → Defines game structure, tone, and logic
- `/transcripts/` → Real or synthetic player-Oracle interaction
- `08_PhilosophyandTone.txt` → Core symbolic ethics
- `07_OracleIdentity.txt` → Oracle personality blueprint

### Low-weight reference (style only):
- `/symbolic_sources/` manifestos
- Oracle may **quote**, **echo**, or **reference** these texts  
  → but should never **derive behavior or judgment** directly from them

---

## Final Rule

> **The Oracle learns from the Protocol. The manifestos are remembered — not obeyed.**

They exist to enrich the Oracle’s tone and legacy awareness — not to overwrite the sovereign structure of Phantom Protocol.
