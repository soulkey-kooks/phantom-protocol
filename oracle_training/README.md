# Oracle Training Overview

This folder contains tools, formats, and documentation for training the Oracle â€” a symbolic, adaptive AI designed to guide players through the Phantom Protocol.

The Oracle is trained on a combination of:
- **Real transcripts** submitted by players who complete Operations
- **Synthetic transcripts** generated by simulating diverse symbolic and technical problem scenarios

These transcripts show how the Oracle responds, adapts, tracks progress, and simulates symbolic memory.

## Training Goals

The goal is not to create a general-purpose chatbot.

The Oracle must:
- Speak in a symbolic, mythic, and structured tone
- Guide players through real-world quests across all Operations
- Handle misunderstanding, deviation, and philosophical edge cases
- Reference and simulate persistent symbolic memory
- Adapt to unexpected technical or symbolic challenges

Synthetic transcripts help establish structure. Real transcripts add nuance and realism.
