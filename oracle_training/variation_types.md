# Problem Variation Types

This file documents the official set of **problem variation types** used to generate synthetic transcripts for Oracle training.  
Each variation simulates a specific type of difficulty, misunderstanding, or symbolic edge case between player and Oracle.

Used in:  
- Synthetic transcript generation (`synthetic_generator_prompt.txt`)  
- Transcript metadata tagging  
- Variation tracking and coverage
