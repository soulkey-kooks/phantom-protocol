# Phantom Protocol – Manifesto

Phantom Protocol is an open-source framework for developing digital sovereignty through symbolic, real-world challenges.

It’s not a tutorial, a course, or a game in the traditional sense. It’s a system that teaches through action — guided by an AI Oracle trained on the paths of those who walked before.

## What We Believe

- People should own their tools — not rent access to security.
- Digital sovereignty is a skillset, not a product.
- Technology should be used for liberation, not surveillance.
- Learning should happen through real-world action, not passive content.

## What We're Building

We’re creating an AI-powered system that helps people:
- Secure their systems
- Understand how the digital world works
- Build real tools and habits of resistance
- Disappear when they choose to
- Act with clarity and intention

This isn’t about making an AI that knows everything.  
It’s about training an Oracle that speaks the language of sovereignty, adapts to your thinking, and remembers what matters.

## Why Open Source

This project only works if it’s transparent.

- The Oracle is trained using a combination of real player transcripts and simulated runs generated from diverse symbolic and technical scenarios.
- The entire structure is inspectable, modifiable, and forkable.
- Anyone can contribute, remix, or improve it — as long as they preserve its values.

Closed systems create dependencies.  
Phantom Protocol removes them.

## The End Goal

- A local, offline Oracle
- Fully trained on real symbolic interaction
- Fully encrypted, memory-aware, and responsive
- No accounts, no cloud, no data collection
- Owned by you — and no one else

## How to Help

Phantom Protocol is an open-source project. If you're here to build, here's exactly how you can contribute:

- **Submit a transcript** after completing an Operation (see `/transcripts/README.md`)
- **Generate synthetic transcripts** using GPT and the official operation files (see `/oracle_training/`)
- **Track variation coverage** — help log which regions and problem types have already been simulated
- **Format transcripts for training** — help prepare datasets for fine-tuning the Oracle
- **Train the Oracle** — when ready, assist with LoRA or full fine-tuning on an open-source model
- **Build a GUI** for the offline version of the Protocol (map, quest log, inventory, etc.)
- **Design the memory system** — a way for the Oracle to write and read from a local `00_Seed.txt` file
- **Share the project** and help bring in more Phantoms to walk the path
- **Join discussions** about ethical boundaries, symbolic design, and long-term implications

Phantom Protocol is an open-source framework built by Nathan James under Soulkey Systems.  
The canonical version — and its original philosophy — live here.
